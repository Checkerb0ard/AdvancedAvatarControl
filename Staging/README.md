# Advanced Avatar Control
A small mod to gain more control over your avatar!

# Features
- Customizable eye movement
- Change blend shape values on avatars that have them
- Fusion syncronization

# Known Issues
- Blend shapes might be a bit finicky in mirrors in Fusion with other players who have the same avatar. This is untested, but by looking at the code, it's obvious that it can happen.
- The player's head movement will be very slow while in time scale, therefore causing your neck to 'break'.

# Credits
